Each topic's questions are grouped into **three** categories: basic, intermediate, and challenging. You are recommended to do all basic problem set before advancing further. 
## Combinational Logic Timing (Basic)

Consider the following combinational logic device.

<img src="/50002/assets/contentimage/pset2/1.png"  class="center_fourty"/>

 Each logic gate has the same:
 - Propagation delay,  tpd= 2ns, 
 - Contamination delay, tcd=1ns

Compute the **overall** propagation delay and contamination delay for the circuit. 

<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
Overall  **tpd** = 6ns (counting paths from the AND gate, OR gate, and XOR gate). 
<br><br>
Overall  **tcd** = 1ns (counting the shortest path from XOR gate). </p></div><br>


## Tracing CMOS Circuit (Basic)

**Draw** the truth table for the following CMOS circuitry:

<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
$$ \begin{matrix}
A & B & C & OUT \\ \hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 
\hline
\end{matrix}
$$
</p></div><br>

## Universal Gates (Basic)

Use only NAND gates to redraw the circuit below. Use as few NAND gates as possible.

<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
If you directly convert with just NAND gates then you'll get:  
<br>

<br>
You can minimise them first by minimising the boolean expression:  $$AC + \bar{A}C + B\bar{C} = C+B\bar{C} = C + B = \overline{\bar{C}\bar{B}}$$<br>
Then we can easily draw the circuitry for the minimised expression:

## Full Adder Timing Analysis (Intermediate)

Refer to the FA circuitry below:

<img src="/50002/assets/contentimage/pset2/8.png"  class="center_fourty"/>

Answer the following questions:
1. **Compute** the  **tpd​**  and  **tcd** of the full adder above.
2.  If we were to put several of these FAs to form an 8-bit ripple-carry adder as shown, **compute** the **tpd** and **tcd**  of an 8-bit ripple-carry adder made of 8 of these FA circuits.

<ol type="1">
<li> The **tpd** is 1.8 and the **tcd**  is 0.3 for a single FA. </li>
<li> For the 8-bit ripple-carry adder, one might think at first that its  **tpd**  is simply 8 times bigger than a single FA, that is 14.4. However, note that inputs  **Ai**, **Bi** are given as a valid signal at the **same time** for all adder units: $$i=0,1,...7$$ That means **Ai** XOR **Bi** computation for all units happen *in parallel* during the first 0.5ns only. 
Hence, the **tpd** of the 8-bit RCA is: $$1.8+7\times1.3=10.9$$</li>
The contamination delay of the 8-bit RCA remains at 0.3ns.</ol></p></div>


## Combinational Construction Rules (Intermediate)

During lecture, we learned a first set of principles that define a combinational device. A combinational device is a circuit element that has:
1.  One or more digital inputs.
2.  One or more digital outputs.
3.  A **functional** specification that details the value of each output for every possible combination of valid input values.
4.  A **timing** specification consisting (at minimum) of an upper bound  **tpd**  on the required time for the device to compute the specified output values from an arbitrary set of stable, valid input values.

We also learned a second set of rules, that a set of interconnected elements ***is*** a combinational device if:
1.  **Each** circuit element is combinational.
2.  Every input is connected to exactly **one** output or to some vast supply of 0's and 1's. 
3.  The circuit contains **no** directed cycles.


{: .note}  
Read point (2) carefully. This does NOT mean that a combinational device must just have one output and one input. This means that for each input of a combinational device, it is connected to exactly ONE output of the "previous" device.

In this problem, we ask you to think carefully about why these rules work - in particular, why *an acyclic circuit of combinational devices,* constructed according to the second principle, is itself a combinational device as defined by the first. 

Consider the following 2-input acyclic circuit whose two components, A and B, are each combinational devices. 

<img src="/50002/assets/contentimage/pset2/3.png"  class="center_fifty"/>


The propagation delay for each device is specified in nanoseconds:
* Device A tpd: 3ns
* Device B tpd: 2ns 

The **functional specifications for each component** are given as truth tables detailing output values for each combination of inputs, where $$A _{a_0, a_1}$$ denotes the output from device A, and $$B _{b_0, b_1}$$ denotes the output from device B:

$$\begin{matrix}
a_0  & a_1  &  A _{a_0, a_1}  &  b_0​  &  b_1  & B_{b_0, b_1}\\ 
\hline \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 
 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
 \hline 
\end{matrix}$$

**Answer** the following questions:

1.  Give a truth table for the **overall** acyclic circuit, i.e. a table that specifies the value of z for each of the possible combinations of input values on x and y.
2.  **Describe** a general procedure by which a truth table can be computed for each output of an arbitrary acyclic circuit containing only combinational components. *Hint : construct a functional specification to each circuit node.* 
3.  **Specify a propagation delay** (the upper bound required for each combinational device) for the circuit.
4.  **Describe** a general procedure by which a propagation delay can be computed for an arbitrary acyclic circuit containing only combinational components. *Hint: add a timing specification to each circuit node*.
5.  Do your general procedures for computing functional specifications and propagation delays work if the restriction to acyclic circuits is relaxed (lifted)? **Explain**.

<ol type="1">
<li> The truth table is as follows:
$$\begin{matrix}
X & Y & Z \\ 
\hline 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline \end{matrix}$$</li>
<li> We can construct the truth table from left to right, i.e: solve the truth table for each component from the leftmost (inputs) all the way to the rightmost (outputs), one by one.</li>
<li> The total propagation delay is the sum of each device's (A and B) propagation delay. This amounts to: $$3 + 2 = 5ns$$</li>
<li>We have to find the <strong>longest</strong> path from (any) input to (any) output to find the <strong>total</strong> propagation delay of the combinational circuit.</li>
<li> No, the signal can <strong>propagate</strong> back into the circuit's input so using the <i>longest</i> path to calculate  **tpd**  is not applicable anymore. </li></ol>
