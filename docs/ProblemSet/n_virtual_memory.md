# Virtual Memory
{: .no_toc}

Each topic's questions are grouped into **three** categories: basic, intermediate, and challenging. You are recommended to do all basic problem set before advancing further. 

## Virtual Memory Trivia (Basic)
Consider a virtual memory system that uses a single-level page map to translate virtual addresses into physical addresses. Each of the questions below asks you to consider what happens when one of the design parameters of the original system is changed.

1. If the physical memory size (in bytes) is **doubled**, how does the number of bits in each entry of the page table change?

	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	**Increases by 1 bit**. Assuming the page size remains the same, there are now twice as many physical pages, so the physical page number needs to expand by 1 bit.
	</p></div><br>

2. If the physical memory size (in bytes) is **doubled**, how does the number of entries in the page map change?

	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	**No change**. The number of entries in the page table is determined by the size of the virtual address and the size of a page. It is <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">not</span> affected by the size of physical memory.
	</p></div><br>

3. If the virtual memory size (in bytes) is doubled, how does the number of bits in each entry of the page table change?
	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	**No change**. The number of bits in a page table entry is determined by the number of control bits (usually 2: dirty and resident) and the number of physical pages – the size of each entry is not affected by the size of virtual memory.
	</p></div><br>

4. If the virtual memory size (in bytes) is doubled, how does the number of entries in the page map change?

	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	The number of entries **doubles**. Assuming the page size remains the same, there are now twice as many virtual pages and so there needs to be twice as many entries in the page map.
	</p></div><br>

5. If the page size (in bytes) is doubled, how does the number of bits in each entry of the page table change?

	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	Each entry is **one bit smaller**. Doubling the page size while maintaining the size of physical memory means there are half as many physical pages as before. So the size of the physical page number field decreases by one bit.
	</p></div><br>

6. If the page size (in bytes) is doubled, how does the number of entries in the page map change?
	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	There are **half** as many entries. Doubling the page size while maintaining the size of virtual memory means there are half as many virtual pages as before. So the number of page table entries is also cut in half.
	</p></div><br>

7. The following table shows the first 8 entries in the page map. Recall that the valid bit is 1 if the page is resident in physical memory and 0 if the page is on disk or hasn’t been allocated. If there are 1024 ($$2^{10}$$) bytes per page, what is the physical address corresponding to the decimal virtual address 3956?<br><br>

	$$
	\begin{matrix}
	\text{Virtual Page} & \text{Valid bit} & \text{Physical page}\\
	\hline
	0 & 0 & 7\\
	1 & 1 & 9\\
	2 & 0 & 3\\
	3 & 1 & 2\\
	4 & 1 & 5\\
	5 & 0 & 5\\
	6 & 0 & 4\\
	7 & 1 & 1\\
	\hline
	\end{matrix}$$<br><br>

	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	`3956 = 0xF74`. So the **VPN** is `3` with a page offset of `0x374`. Looking up page table entry for **VPN** 3, we see that the page is resident in memory (valid bit = `1`) and lives in physical page (**PPN**) `2`. So the corresponding physical address is `(2<<10)+0x374 = 0xB74 = 2932`.
	</p></div><br>


## Page Replacement (Basic)

Consider two possible page-replacement strategies: 
* **LRU** (the least recently used page is replaced) 
* **FIFO** (the page that has been in the memory longest is replaced
 
The merit of a page-replacement strategy is judged by its **hit ratio** or **miss rate**. The larger the hit ratio (or equivalently, the smaller the miss ratio), the better that cache is. 

For this question, assume that after space has been reserved for the page table, the interrupt service routines, and the operating-system kernel, there is only sufficient room left in the main memory for four user-program pages. Assume also that initially virtual pages 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the user program are brought into physical memory in that order.

1. For each of the two strategies, what pages will be in the memory at the end of the following sequence of virtual page accesses? Read the sequence from left to right: (6, 3, 2, 8, 4).
	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	**LRU**:<br>
	start: 4 3 2 1<br>
	access 6: replace 1 => 6 4 3 2<br>
	access 3: reorder list => 3 6 4 2<br>
	access 2: reorder list => 2 3 6 4<br>
	access 8: replace 4 => 8 2 3 6<br>
	access 4: replace 6 => 4 8 2 3<br>
	<br>
	**FIFO**:<br>
	start: 4 3 2 1<br>
	access 6: replace 1 => 6 4 3 2<br>
	access 3: no change => 6 4 3 2<br>
	access 2: no change => 6 4 3 2<br>
	access 8: replace 2 => 8 6 4 3<br>
	access 4: no change => 8 6 4 3
	</p></div><br>

2. Which (if either) replacement strategy will work best when the machine accesses pages in the following (*stack*) order: (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, ...)?

	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	LRU misses on pages 3 & 7, hence having 2/8 miss rate. FIFO doesn’t work well on stack accesses, as it will have 5/8 miss rate.
	</p></div><br>

3. Which (if either) replacement strategy will work best when the machine accesses pages in the following (repeated sequence) order: (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...)?
	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	Both strategies have a **100% miss rate** in the steady state.
	</p></div><br>

4. Which (if either) replacement strategy will work best when the machine accesses pages in a *randomly* selected order, such as (3, 4, 2, 8, 7, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 8, ...)?
	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	**Neither** FIFO nor LRU is guaranteed to be the better strategy in dealing with random accesses since there is no locality to the reference stream.
	</p></div><br>


## VA-PA Address Translation (Basic)

Consider a virtual memory system that uses a single-level page map to translate virtual addresses into physical addresses. The following table shows the first 8 entries in the page map. If there are `1024` ($$2^{10}$$) bytes per page, what is the physical address corresponding to the virtual address `0x1C92`?

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/93f6hoa3nk9iyah/vapa.png?raw=1"  class="center_thirty">

<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
The PA is <code>0x0492</code>. You can obtain it by figuring out how many bits the **VPN** has. 
<br><br>
Given that there are `1024` bytes per page, this gives us the clue that `PO` (Page Offset) is **10 bits**, which means that **VPN** is consisted of **6 bits**: <code> 000111</code>. 
<br><br>
From the table, we find that the **PPN** is <code>1</code> for **VPN** `7`. 
<br><br>
Appending **PPN** and **PO** and making it 16 bits hex representation, we have PO: <code> 0010010010 </code> and PPN: <code> 000001</code>. Appending the entire `PA` together and converting them to hex results in <code>0x0492</code>.
</p></div><br>



## VM Party (Intermediate)

Refer to the state of RAM, pagetable, and TLB below. The addresses in the RAM, D, and R bits are written in binary, while the VPN, PPN, and LRU are written in Decimal.

**The biggest LRU number refers to the MOST recently used item and vice versa,** and that BYTE addressing is used. The total size of the RAM is 4 PAGES and the total number of entries in the pagetable is 8. The letter A, B, C, and D written in the RAM table below refers to the entire page, meaning that address `000000` to `001100` belong to page A, address `010000` to `011100` belong to page B, and so on.

1. How many bits is PO, PPN, and VPN?

	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	 **PO** is 4 bits, **PPN** is 2 bits, **VPN** is 3 bits.
	</p></div><br>

2. Which of the following instructions **does not** require access to the pagetable? Assume that the pagetable, ram, and TLB presented refers the *data* portion only, so obviously instructions that does not do `LD` or `ST` does not require access to either of the three tables presented above. Assume also that each of the four scenarios are called separately (independent of one another) on the virtual memory state as in the figure above. 
	1.	`ST(R0, 0b1111100, R31)`
	2.	`ST(R0, 0b0110100, R31)`
	3.	`ADDC(R31, 0x3, R0), ST(R0, 0b0010100, R31)`
	4.	`ADDC(R31, 0b1000000, R2), LD(R2, 0b0011000, R3), SHLC(R3, 0x4, R3)`
	
	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	You <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">don't</span> require access to the pagetable if the entry is already cached at the TLB. The second and third instruction all require translation of **VPN** `3` and **VPN** `1` which are both present in the TLB. This means we don't need to access the pagetable anymore. The fourth instruction requires access to the pagetable because you're accessing VPN 5 instead of VPN 1 because `EA = Reg[R2] + 0b0011000`.  
	</p></div><br>

3. We want to call the following instruction: `ST(R31, 0b1100100, R31)`. Where is this data with VA of`0b1100100` located?

	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	**VPN** `6` is not resident. Therefore it is on disk. 
	</p></div><br>

4. Where will the content for VPN 6 be located in the RAM after the instruction `ST(R31, 0b1100100, R31)` is executed, i.e: which data -- A, B, C, or D will be replaced by the content of VPN 6?

	<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
	It will replace data `B` since its **PPN** is not in the pagetable (means that its not a relevant content and can be overwritten). 
	</p></div><br>

5. Draw the state of the TLB after `ST(R31, 0b1100100, R31)` is executed.
